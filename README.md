# Hello there!

The goal of this exercise is to extend this "Github Repo Search" application. The application currently lists the projects of the Netflix Github organization by fetching from Github's REST API:

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos

## Feature requests

Please implement the following features.

1. **Ability to view the repos of any Github Organization (eg. Netflix)** The user should be able to choose which organization is being listed.
1. **Include a subset of the returned repo data that you feel is meaningful to your user, and present it in a simple and usable way** Please document your choice at the end of this README
1. **Ability to view an individual repo's recent commits**
1. **Display results such that they are easy to read and parse**
1. **Create shareable urls for the results of listing the repos of an organization** ie. a url that can be shared so another user could view an organization's repos
1. **Any other enhancements you feel would make for a more compelling product** Please timebox this appropriately. See the "Time estimate" section below

We've purposefully left the details open to your own interpretation, so feel free to get creative with your solution.

## Developing locally

Run `yarn` and `yarn start` to start developing locally.

## Time estimate

Our expectation is that this exercise can be completed in about 2 hours. Please prioritize your efforts to be close to this constraint. If you have other enhancements and creative ideas you want to showcase and if they will take you over this time constraint, please use the "Your README" section at the end to describe your ideas rather than implementing them.

## Documentation

Please document your submission at the end (separate section is provided at the bottom). In your documentation, please provide the following:

- The approach you've taken with your solution, calling out any decisions / tradeoffs you made or interesting areas of code
- The next steps you would take to improve upon your solution
- The total time you spent on the exercise

## Submitting your solution
